          <h2>BREAKFAST</h2>
          <p>
            Breakfast is the first meal of the day, typically eaten in the
            morning. It provides the initial energy boost after a night’s sleep
            and is often considered essential for kickstarting metabolism.
            Common breakfast foods include eggs, toast, cereal, fruits, yogurt,
            and beverages like coffee, tea, or juice. Some cultures also have
            savory breakfast options like rice dishes or soups.

          <h2>LUNCH</h2>
          <p>
            Lunch is typically the midday meal, providing fuel to keep energy
            levels stable through the afternoon. It often includes a balance of
            protein, carbohydrates, and vegetables. Lunch options vary widely
            depending on cultural preferences and lifestyle but often feature
            sandwiches, salads, soups, rice or pasta dishes, and various
            proteins like chicken, fish, or legumes.

          <h2>DINNER</h2>
          <p>
            Dinner is usually the last meal of the day, often eaten in the
            evening. It can be a lighter meal, but in many cultures, it’s the
            main meal and may be more elaborate. Dinners typically include
            cooked vegetables, proteins such as meat or plant-based
            alternatives, grains like rice or potatoes, and possibly dessert.
            Dinner is often a time for family or social gatherings, so it may
            also be the most leisurely meal of the day.
